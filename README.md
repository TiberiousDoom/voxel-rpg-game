## 🎯 Game Overview

### What is Voxel RPG Game?

Voxel RPG Game is a **settlement management simulation** where you:

1. **Start with nothing** - Begin in the Survival tier with minimal resources
2. **Build your settlement** - Place buildings strategically on a grid
3. **Manage resources** - Balance production and consumption
4. **Grow your population** - Spawn NPCs and assign them to jobs
5. **Advance tiers** - Unlock new buildings and features as you progress
6. **Face challenges** - Handle random events, disasters, and resource scarcity

### Gameplay Loop

```
Place Buildings → Assign NPCs → Produce Resources → Expand Territory → Advance Tiers
       ↑                                                                    ↓
       └────────────────────── Unlock New Features ←──────────────────────┘
```

### Progression Path

1. **SURVIVAL Tier** (0-15 minutes)
   - Learn basic building and resource production
   - Build campfires, shelters, storage huts
   - Goal: Survive and accumulate basic resources

2. **SETTLEMENT Tier** (15-60 minutes)
   - Build farms, houses, warehouses
   - Spawn and manage NPCs
   - Establish production chains
   - Goal: Create a thriving settlement

3. **KINGDOM Tier** (60+ minutes)
   - Unlock advanced buildings (mines, workshops, castles)
   - Large-scale resource management
   - Optimize production efficiency
   - Goal: Build a massive, prosperous kingdom

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Technology Stack

```
React 18          → UI components, rendering
Zustand           → State management
Custom JS Engine  → Game logic (13+ modules)
HTML5 Canvas      → 2D viewport rendering
localStorage      → Browser-based save/load
```

### System Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│      React UI (6 Components)            │
│   GameScreen, Viewport, Panels, Menus   │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
               │ useGameManager hook
┌──────────────▼──────────────────────────┐
│         GameManager (Engine)            │
│  ModuleOrchestrator + 13 Game Modules   │
│  • Foundation  • Buildings  • Resources │
│  • NPCs        • Territory  • Morale    │
│  • Production  • Events     • More...   │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
               │
┌──────────────▼──────────────────────────┐
│     BrowserSaveManager (Persistence)    │
│  localStorage + IndexedDB + Validation  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Design Principles:**
- **Modular** - Independent modules with clear boundaries
- **Event-Driven** - React updates via events (500ms debounce)
- **Single Source of Truth** - Game state in one place
- **No Backend** - Entirely client-side

See **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** for full details.

## 🎮 How to Play

### Basic Controls

1. **Start the game** - Click "Start Game" button
2. **Place a building** - Select from build menu, click grid to place
3. **Spawn NPCs** - Click "Spawn NPC" button
4. **Assign NPCs** - Click building, then assign NPCs to it
5. **Watch resources grow** - Production happens automatically every 5 seconds
6. **Save progress** - Click "Save Game" to save to browser
7. **Load game** - Click "Load Game" to restore from saved state

### Tips for Success

- **Build farms early** - Food is critical; NPCs consume food every tick
- **Assign NPCs to buildings** - Production multipliers increase with assigned NPCs
- **Manage storage** - Build warehouses to increase capacity
- **Balance consumption** - Ensure food production exceeds consumption
- **Unlock tiers** - Meet tier requirements to unlock advanced buildings

### Resource Production

| Building | Produces | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| FARM | Food | Primary food source; critical for NPCs |
| LUMBERYARD | Wood | Used for most buildings |
| QUARRY | Stone | Used for advanced buildings |
| MINE | Gold | Rare resource for special buildings |
| WORKSHOP | Goods | Crafted items (future use) |

### NPC Roles

- **FARMER** - +25% efficiency on farms
- **CRAFTSMAN** - +25% efficiency on workshops
- **GUARD** - Reduces event damage
- **SETTLER** - General worker
