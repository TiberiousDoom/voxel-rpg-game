## Archived Content

### 2D React Prototype (`archive-code/2d-prototype/`)

**Archived:** November 2025
**Reason:** Project transitioning to new implementation based on 2D planning documents

The complete React/JavaScript 2D prototype has been archived, including:

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `src/` | Complete source code (components, systems, rendering, etc.) |
| `scripts/` | Build and generation scripts |
| `tools/` | Sprite generator and utilities |
| `docs/` | Original game vision documents |
| `public/` | React entry HTML and config files |
| `documentation/` | All historical documentation (planning, reports, guides, etc.) |

**Key Documents in Archive:**
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - System architecture documentation
- `CURRENT_STATUS.md` - Development status at time of archive
- `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` - Implementation patterns and formulas
- `documentation/planning/` - All previous implementation plans
- `documentation/reports/` - Audit reports and phase completion reports
- `documentation/history/` - Development notes and investigations

**Note:** Game assets remain in `public/assets/` and were NOT archived.

See [archive-code/2d-prototype/README.md](archive-code/2d-prototype/README.md) for restoration instructions.
