## Vision Statement

### Tagline

> *Rise from ruin. Build something worth protecting. You're not alone.*

### The Pitch

In a world torn apart by a war between gods, you are an ordinary farmer who refuses to let the darkness win. Guided by a mystical companion, you'll learn to wield magic, rally survivors, and transform a fragile camp into a thriving stronghold. Command autonomous NPCs who work alongside you—not for you—as you close the portals that scar the land and push back the monsters that pour through. This is not a story of a chosen hero; it's the story of what ordinary people can build when they stand together.

### Core Experience

**Primary Feeling:** Satisfaction through achievement

**Focus:** The journey—exploration, survival, building up—while achieving meaningful goals along the way.

---

## Core Pillars

The game experience is built on five pillars, in order of priority:

| Priority | Pillar | Promise |
|----------|--------|---------|
| 1 | **Build** | Transform wilderness into a fortified village, tile by tile |
| 2 | **Grow** | Attract NPCs with personalities who live, work, and fight alongside you |
| 3 | **Reclaim** | Close portals, clear monsters, and take back the world |
| 4 | **Choose** | Engage the story when you want; the sandbox is always there |
| 5 | **Connect** | Play solo with your companion, or build together with friends |

### Pillar Details

#### 1. Build (Primary)
Building is the heart of the game. Players should feel:
- Pride in what they've created
- Progression from humble shelter to mighty stronghold
- Creative freedom within a 2D tile-based world
- The satisfaction of seeing NPCs use and inhabit their creations

#### 2. Grow (Colony/Simulation)
The settlement is alive:
- NPCs arrive as your settlement grows
- Each NPC has personality and preferences
- Relationships form between NPCs and with the player
- The community feels organic, not managed

#### 3. Reclaim (Combat/Exploration)
The world needs healing:
- Portals spawn monsters and corrupt the land
- Closing portals is challenging but rewarding
- Reclaimed territory can be settled and developed
- Combat serves the story, not the other way around

#### 4. Choose (Freedom)
Player agency is paramount:
- Story content is optional, not forced
- Multiple valid playstyles (builder, warrior, explorer, manager)
- No "right way" to play
- The sandbox is always available

#### 5. Connect (Multiplayer)
Building together:
- Solo play with companion is complete experience
- Multiplayer enhances but doesn't replace solo
- Shared settlements and cooperative building
- Friends can drop in and out

## Design Principles

These principles guide all design decisions:

### NPCs Should Feel Helpful, Never Like a Chore

**Do:**
- NPCs work autonomously on tasks
- NPCs make reasonable decisions without input
- NPCs handle routine work so players can focus on interesting choices
- NPCs communicate their needs clearly

**Don't:**
- Require constant micromanagement
- Make NPCs wait for permission on obvious tasks
- Force players to babysit pathfinding or task assignment
- Create "idle NPC" problems

### The Player is a Participant, Not Just a Manager

**Do:**
- Let players work alongside NPCs
- Make player contribution meaningful but optional
- Reward hands-on play without punishing delegation
- Give players tools NPCs don't have (magic, special abilities)

**Don't:**
- Make the player feel like a cursor clicking on menus
- Remove all agency to NPCs
- Make manual work feel pointless compared to delegation
- Force players into pure management if they want to build

### Progression Should Feel Earned

**Do:**
- Gate advancement behind meaningful achievements
- Make each tier feel like a real upgrade
- Celebrate milestones visually and mechanically
- Let players see how far they've come

**Don't:**
- Gate progress behind arbitrary timers
- Make progression feel like a grind
- Hide progress behind RNG
- Make early game feel pointless in retrospect

### The World Should Feel Alive

**Do:**
- NPCs have schedules, preferences, relationships
- Weather and seasons affect gameplay
- Monsters have behaviors, not just spawn points
- The world changes based on player actions

**Don't:**
- Make NPCs feel like robots
- Create static, unchanging environments
- Spawn enemies from nowhere with no logic
- Ignore player impact on the world

### Complexity Should Be Discoverable

**Do:**
- Start simple, reveal depth over time
- Let players learn by doing
- Provide optional tutorials for advanced systems
- Make basic play intuitive

**Don't:**
- Front-load all mechanics in tutorial
- Hide critical systems from new players
- Require wiki reading to play effectively
- Punish players for not knowing hidden mechanics

## The World

### Setting

A mythical, apocalyptic fantasy world—once prosperous, now scarred by divine conflict.

### Visual Style: 2D Tile-Based

- **Perspective:** Top-down or side-scrolling (depending on implementation)
- **Art Style:** Pixel art or stylized 2D sprites
- **Tilemap System:** Grid-based construction and terrain
- **Scale:** Intimate settlement building to epic portal battles

### The Cataclysm

A war between powerful beings (gods or similar entities) tore reality itself. The conflict between Good and Evil wasn't won—it was interrupted. Now:

- **Portals/tears** scar the landscape, spewing monsters
- **Corruption** spreads from unclosed portals
- **Survivors** are scattered, seeking safety
- **The old world** exists in ruins, holding secrets and resources

### The Stakes

- **Survival:** Monsters roam freely; nowhere is truly safe
- **Reclamation:** Each closed portal is territory reclaimed
- **Rebuilding:** Civilization must be rebuilt from scratch
- **Mystery:** What caused the war? Can it end?

### The Ongoing Threat

Victory is never permanent. The forces of darkness don't accept defeat:

- **Portal Resurgence:** Monsters will attempt to reopen closed portals
- **Territory Reclamation:** Undefended areas can fall back to monster control
- **Corruption Creep:** Neglected regions slowly corrupt again
- **Escalation:** Stronger monsters emerge to challenge growing settlements

This creates meaningful choices:
- Expand aggressively or consolidate and defend?
- Spread NPCs thin to hold territory or concentrate forces?
- Prioritize offense (closing new portals) or defense (protecting closed ones)?

The world pushes back—your achievements matter because they require protection.

### Aesthetic

- **Visual:** 2D tile-based, stylized, readable at a glance
- **Tone:** Hopeful despite darkness—focus on rebuilding, not despair
- **Audio:** Dynamic music that reflects settlement mood and danger level
- **Scale:** Intimate settlement building to epic portal battles

---

## The Companion Arc

The mystical companion is central to the player's journey, serving as guide, teacher, and friend. Their relationship begins with rescue and grows into true partnership.

### The Core Dynamic

**Mutual Growth:** The player and companion grow stronger together. As the player develops skills and builds their settlement, the companion heals from their wounds and regains their power. Neither outpaces the other—they rise together.

### Phase 1: The Rescue

**When:** Game start

**Relationship:** Rescuer and rescued

**The Companion's State:**
- Gravely wounded, barely clinging to existence
- Power severely diminished
- Vulnerable and in need of protection

**What Happens:**
- Player (a displaced farmer) discovers the wounded companion
- Player chooses to help despite their own desperate situation
- Companion stabilizes but remains weak
- A bond forms through this act of compassion

**The Companion Offers:**
- Gratitude and loyalty
- Fragments of knowledge about the cataclysm
- Promise to repay the kindness when able
- Basic survival guidance (what little they can manage)

**Teaching:** Minimal—companion is too weak. Basic tips only.

### Phase 2: Recovery & Trust

**When:** Early game

**Relationship:** Cautious allies, growing closer

**The Companion's State:**
- Slowly healing as player provides safety and care
- Regaining fragments of power
- Still limited but increasingly helpful

**What Happens:**
- Companion helps with settlement basics as strength allows
- Explains the portals, monsters, and their connection to the conflict
- Reveals they are bound to help the player (but not why yet)
- Begins teaching fundamental magic as they recover enough to do so

**Teaching:**
- Basic magical abilities (light, minor protection)
- How to sense portal corruption
- NPC interaction basics

### Phase 3: True Partnership

**When:** Mid game

**Relationship:** Trusted friends, equals

**The Companion's State:**
- Substantially healed
- Power returning in full
- Now a capable ally, not just a guide

**What Happens:**
- Shares their origin (connected to the divine conflict)
- Their growing strength mirrors the player's achievements
- Offers strategic advice on portals
- Develops genuine care for player and settlement
- Can now actively assist in dangerous situations

**Teaching:**
- Intermediate magic (combat spells, utility magic)
- Advanced building techniques
- Portal closing rituals

### Phase 4: Revelation

**When:** Late game (optional story content)

**Relationship:** Bonded partners

**Role:**
- Full history revealed
- Their fate connected to resolving the conflict
- May require player choice affecting their future
- Becomes crucial to confronting major threats

**Teaching:**
- Advanced/master magic
- Secrets of the old world
- The truth about the cataclysm

### Companion Design Principles

- **Always helpful, never annoying:** Companion offers help, doesn't nag
- **Earns their place:** Companion contributes meaningfully to gameplay
- **Grows with player:** Their power and personality develop over time
- **Optional depth:** Surface relationship works; deep engagement rewards
- **Not a crutch:** Player succeeds because of their choices, not companion's power

## NPC Philosophy

### Core Belief

NPCs are companions in building, not tools to be managed.

### NPC Types

#### The Companion (Unique)
- Present from game start
- Teaches magic
- Has deep story integration
- Cannot leave or die permanently

#### Settlers (Common)
- Arrive as settlement grows
- Have personalities and preferences
- Can specialize in roles
- Form relationships with each other
- Can leave if unhappy (with warning)

#### Merchants (Visiting)
- Arrive periodically
- Offer trade opportunities
- Bring news from other settlements
- May become permanent if conditions right

#### Specialists (Rare)
- Attracted by specific buildings or achievements
- Bring unique skills
- Have specific needs
- Significantly boost capabilities

### Autonomy Principles

**NPCs Should:**
- Find work without being assigned
- Prioritize sensibly (defense > construction > comfort)
- Communicate their status clearly
- Handle routine tasks independently
- React to threats appropriately
- Have lives outside of work (rest, socialize, hobbies)

**NPCs Should Not:**
- Stand idle when work exists
- Walk into obvious danger
- Ignore critical needs (food, rest, safety)
- Require micromanagement for basic tasks
- Feel interchangeable or robotic

### The "Castle Story Problem"

Castle Story required constant babysitting of NPCs. We solve this by:

1. **Smart defaults:** NPCs make good decisions without input
2. **Priority system:** Players set priorities, NPCs figure out details
3. **Clear communication:** NPCs explain what they're doing and why
4. **Graceful failure:** When NPCs can't do something, they explain why
5. **Player override:** Players CAN micromanage if they want to, but don't have to
